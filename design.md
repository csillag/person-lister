# Developer documentation

This document explains the background of the project; the major
design decisions, the used components, etc.

This information is *not required* if only want to deploy/run the app;
this is indended for developers who intend to reuse / modify the code.

## Major components / technologies

### UI framework

I have built the UI using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
which is currently my favorite UI framwwork. I have also used Angular
(for a bit more than two years), but I find the concepts of React
more elegant and more intuitive. (Also, in React there is a smaller
number of core concepts, which makes it easier to really *get it right*,
as opposed to Angular.)
